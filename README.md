What is this?
#######_#######_#######_#######_

Bees-r-us is a company which sells drones (electronic flying vehicles) and drone stations (for charging said vehicles). These drones look after bees, fight off their enemies (wasps), and track lots of data about the bees which can be used for making reports to wave angrily at the government. This is important because bees are pollinators and we need them or the food chain collapses! The government won't do anything (without lots of angry citizens waving data-filled-reports at them), but you can;
use our drones to help bees near you!

How do I get involved?
#######_#######_#######_#######_

You sign up on our bees-r-us website to get an account, you can then buy drone-stations and drones which will be sent to your address; they will be pre-configured to connect to your account with us. You put drone station(s) on the side of your house or workplace, connect it to electricity and internet, and it will connect to the bees-r-us server. From our website, you can log in and see how much impact they are having!

Wait, the drones do what?
#######_#######_#######_#######_

Bees - The drones fly around identifying bees and giving each one a name. They record information about the bees over time, such as their preference for which flower, where and how they die, the amount of nectar gathered

Flowers - They identify every flower near the station. They record when they die, how many bees visit them, the kind of flower it is.

Wasps - Wasps are at war with bees, they fight each other. The drones help bees by hunting wasps. Each wasp is given a name, and the drones attempt to destroy them, though they can fit through small places to escape. The drones record instances of wasps killing bees and vice versa.

Drones - drones each have their own AI. Sometimes it goes wrong and they start killing bees by mistaking them for wasps; or are very clumsy in their wasp hunting and hit collatarol bees. Drones inform on each other, comrade!

What does the website record?
#######_#######_#######_#######_

The website identifies hotspots for bee deaths and the causes, so e.g. if its a particular busy road perhaps a bee-bridge of some sort _could_ be constructed. It also keeps a most wanted list of notorious wasps who keep evading drones. It has a hall of fame for bees who are prolific at defeating wasps, collecting nectar, etc. It also identifies queen bees, specifically which ones tend to make workerbees that like flower x and which queen bees make worker bees which tend to like flower y; so if
there's part of the country where there's lots of a particular flower it can recommend the relocation of queen bees there. The RSPBBB (Royal Society for the Protection of Big Booty Bees) regularly checks the site to see if they should move a queen bee somewhere. Your support of this project makes it possible through the data your drones gather!
If your drones go crazy, your drone station will disable the drone when it docks to recharge.
